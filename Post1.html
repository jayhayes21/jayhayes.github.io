    <center><h2>Are the Warriors done?</h2></center>
    <center><h2>Posted: December 29, 2020</h2></center>
    <p> It is only 3 games into a long 72 game season for the Golden State Warriors
        and while their season is certainly not over at this point there have already been a lot of troubling signs that might
        suggest that they could miss the playoffs this season.</p>
    <p> For starters the Western Conference this season is as loaded as it has
        ever been with every team thinking they could get a playoff spot. I think OKC is maybe one of the only teams that is
        really in a re-building year and probably will not make the playoffs, but they play hard and have a good combo of
        young players, like Luguentz Dort and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, and some wily vets, like George Hill and Al Horford.
        Every other team out west will be competing hard for those playoff spots and this means that Golden State cannot
        afford to take any nights off because unlike in years past they are not loaded down with talent that the rest of
        the league simply could not match. On top of this there are some troubling signs as well that I see on the court
        when I watch this team plays that gives me hesitation about if they can make the playoffs out west.</p>
    <p> Anyone that has watched the games can see that this team is struggling
        right now on offense, especially when they play some of the top teams. They have not shot above 40% from the 3-point
        line in any game this year and Steph is struggling to get good looks without Kevin Durant or Klay Thompson to attract
        the defense. Now Draymond Green has yet to play this season and I do think he will take some of the playmaking
        workload off Steph and help in that regard. When you are a team struggling in the half court to create offense
        like Golden State this season you need to create shots in transition or off offensive rebounds when defenses are
        not completely set. The problem is that they do not have a lot of size overall as a team to get offensive rebounds
        and their defense is not good enough right now to force turnovers in the half-court against good teams.
        Against the Bucks the Warriors lost the offensive rebound margin by 1 and had 11 less points off turnovers.
        In their opener against the Nets they had the same number of offensive rebounds as the Nets and had 4 more points
        off turnovers, but they gave up 16 more fast break points. These are the little stats that the Warriors must win
        now that they struggle in the half-court because they do not have the offensive firepower of Klay Thompson or
        Kevin Durant.</p>
    <p> One thing that goes unnoticed about not only the absence of
        Klay Thompson this season is not only his elite ability to shoot the basketball and guard perimeter players,
        but the way he hit shots. Some of the shots that he hits just demoralizes you as a defense because you could play
        perfect defense when the ball gets swung to him and because of his quick release and accuracy it does not matter.
        In Klay Thompsonâ€™s worst shooting season, he shot 40.1% from three which is almost 5% higher than
        either Kelly Oubre Jr. or Andrew Wiggins, the two wing players currently starting for Golden State,
        best season from the three points line. I think it is still too early to declare that Golden State
        cannot make the playoffs in the Western Conference even though it is loaded, but I think they will need to
        make some big roster moves in order to be able to be a championship team this year without Klay Thompson.</p>
