<li class="info">Used AJAX, HTML/CSS, and Python to improve various UI components. One of these components was the ability for the user to see the status of executing jobs
to get a better understanding of how much more time it may take for the job to finish executing. </li>
<li class="info">Improved testing script for developer branches using Python and shell scripts. We use the shell script to make sure that all whl files are successfully
install which contains all the Python modules we will use, verify our code executes a sample test with one of our services and PDW files. The Python script utilizes
logger statements to verify that all of our services are up and running.</li>
<li class="info">Developed a UI feature to bypass unnecessary services for user testing. Created a checkbox within our homepage which will be flagged using JS and 
then Python will be used to implement the functionality to skip the service.</li>

<p style="text-align:left">Industrial Engineer</p>
<ul>
	<li class="info">Created an excel-like website to store company information into a SQL database.
		The goal of this project was to give employees an easy way to enter in daily information without the delay time
		that our Excel sheets were causing and then we as engineers can move the data to Excel at the beginning and end of the day. The Excel sheets were causing delays because of how big they were (up to 100 kB)
		and they had formulas and graphs that needed to be updated within them upon every data entry. Since it took employees time to enter in all this information
		they were not using as much of their time on producing products as desired by the company.</li>
	<li class="info">Taught an Excel course to factory employees to increase familiarity with the software. Excel was
		the primary tool that the factory employees who worked on the floor used everyday. There were a lot of issues
		that came about from Excel that was just because these employees were unfamiliar with the software.
		During the course I taught we went over conditional statements, graphs, pivot tables, and
		how to fix common errors that I saw them run across during coop at Hartz.</li>
	<li class="info">Troubleshooted problems on various machines daily. I would go around with my supervisor, Chris Bryant,
		and look at machines that went down and try to get them back up and running as quickly as possibly
		to continue producing product. Most of the issues on the machines were primarily mechanical issues from parts
		either wearing out or being in improper places. Some of the electrical issues involved sensors being misplaced
		or not working properly, wires being pulled out, and employees setting up machines with the wrong settings
		based on the product that they were running for that day.</li>
	<li class="info">Drafted mechanical and electrical drawings in DraftSight of company machines.</li>
	<li class="info">Revised downtime tracking sheets in Excel to oversee daily production.</li>
	<li class="info">Proposed solutions to larger issues on machines by communicating with vendors to create cost and performance sheets.</li>
